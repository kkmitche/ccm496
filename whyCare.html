                <p>Algorithms are shaping the world we live in, and no one is exempt from their influence in our lives. Your data is being collected and used against you in ways you can't even fathom. You are being manipulated, whether you realize it or
                    not, and AI is controlling opportunities that come your way. Whether that be applying for a job, receiving healthcare benefits, approving a housing application, or determining your credit score, AI is bound to impact you in one capacity
                    or another.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>It's crucial for you to understand how our digital infrastructure functions so that you can arm yourself for battle in the war happening all around you. Technology is not all bad, but our current structure allows for too much power in
                    the hands of too few people, threatening the future of our democracy and freedom.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Don't let this overwhelm you - let it empower you. Stand up and make a change. The movement is already in motion, it just needs more momentum and you can be a part of it.
