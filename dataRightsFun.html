                <h1>Are Data Rights Fundamental Rights?</h1>

                <blockquote>"Data rights should be considered just fundamental rights." - Ravi Naik, Data Rights Solicitor featured in The Great Hack
                </blockquote>
                <br/>
                <p>While this may sound like a silly question, it's one worth taking a closer look into. According to Brittany Kaiser, "Data has surpassed oil in value, and is now the most valuable asset on Earth" (Amer & Noujaim, 2019). There's no question
                    that our data is valuable, but it's crucial we understand just <i>how</i> valuable it is and who has the rights to it. From a user's perspective, it makes sense that we should have access to our data, but from a company's perspective,
                    they argue sole ownership of it. This collision of power is where things get messy.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Many companies claim users' data as intellectual property that is solely theirs for using however they wish. They argue that we, as users, willingly give out our personal information. For instance, "If Zuckerberg is guilty of crimes against
                    democracy, then he has had 2.5 billion accomplices - the people around the globe who accepted Facebook's terms of service and posted their data on its site" (Gastil & Davies 5). While users agree to the terms of service, they are nearly
                    impossible to avoid. This argument fails to recognize that users have to use these platforms, like Google or Facebook, for jobs and educational purposes, utilizing them to share documents and collaborate with colleagues. Having the
                    ability to opt out would require a shift in our entire digital infrastructure.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>As users, it's critical to call attention to our data being collected since it's not visible to us. The only way for us to have access to it would be for data rights to be considered property rights. Users can only possess and track their
                    data when they own it, which would require a legal battle with the companies currently collecting it. At this point, you are likely wondering, "Why would I want to own my data?" Excellent question. Data rights becoming property rights
                    are essential for the future of our democracy.
                </p>

                <blockquote>"Our personal data is out there being used against us in ways we don't understand." - Carole Cadwalladr, featured in The Great Hack
                </blockquote>
                <br/>
                <p>As Carole Cadwalladr explicitly points out, our data is being weaponized against us in a war we can't physically see. Our data is being used for behavioral modification models that are affecting job applications, health insurance coverage,
                    credit card scores, prison sentences, and even voting outcomes on a global scale. Data rights truly are fundamental human rights as they determine our digital democracy.
