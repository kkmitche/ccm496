                <p>How can we regulate something that we can't even define? We know we need transparency and regulation, but how can we push for these when we don't have a name for what we need transparent and regulated? Technology in the digital age has
                    reached a complexity that no one can seem to categorize, but once we do, we can attribute the appropriate funding model to it. There are multiple models that we can draw from, such as the Public Broadcasting Model, or the Public Utility
                    Model, but ultimately we need to reach some kind of fiduciary model in order to combat this asymmetrical system of power we are facing.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>John Gastil and Todd Davies propose the Corporation for Public Software (CPS), based on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). This model "would foster the creation of new digital technology by providing a stable source of funding
                    to nonprofit technologists, interest groups, civic organizations, government, researchers, private companies, and the public" (Gastil & Davies 1), ultimately encouraging digital infrastructure to benefit the public good. Looking at
                    the CPB in the United States, its mission is to produce and distribute content that benefits the public interest through providing an alternative to mainstream commercial broadcasting and advertising. Translating this into the CPS
                    would mean funding and producing noncommercial software. This model looks promising in the sense that "PBS has been named the most trusted media outlet in the United States for the past 16 years" (Gastil & Davies 13), proving a success
                    rate in trust and repertoire with the public.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Another option for regulation can be to treat our digital infrastructure as a utility, looking upon the Public Utility Model. In this scenario, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other monopolies would be held accountable to
                    public standards through forced transparency and regulation to benefit the public sphere. One option for this accountability entails taxing data, which would require Google and Facebook to release how much data they collect, and would
                    theoretically place a restriction on this data collection. Even if this tax is not a high monetary value, it would nonetheless force these companies to be transparent in how much data they are collecting, shocking the public with the
                    data points they collect on each of us.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Regardless of how we choose to go about it, it's critical that our digital infrastructure shifts toward a fiduciary model - one that protects us from the asymmetrical system of power currently in place. A fiduciary relationship is one
                    of equal power from both parties, which is what Silicon Valley wants us to believe we currently have now; however, this is not the case. While we are the ones scrolling, clicking, and liking, we must remember that there are thousands
                    of engineers behind our screens who know exactly what to do to keep us scrolling, clicking and liking. This right here is where the inequality comes in! Tech professionals are using persuasive and manipulative strategies to keep us
                    plugged in, but refuse to take responsibility for this. This is why we need a fiduciary model so that we can regulate this power system.
                </p>

                <blockquote>"In order for services to be rendered in this context, they have to collect information from the client that could be used to compromise the integrity of that client. The degree of that compromising information is the degree to which it
                    must not be an equal contract relationship. And the big deception in Silicon Valley is that they are in an equal party's relationship.'' - Tristan Harris, host of Your Undivided Attention podcast

                <br/>
                <p>It's essential that we categorize technology and our digital infrastructure in order to achieve regulation and transparency. While there are a variety of models we can analyze to do this, we must find one that reaches a fiduciary relationship
                    to protect the public from the current asymmetrical system of power in place.
